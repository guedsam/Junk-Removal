            Understanding Hoarding: More Than Just Clutter
          </h2>
          
          <p>
            Hoarding disorder affects millions of Americans, creating living situations that can become unsafe and overwhelming. Unlike typical clutter, hoarding involves persistent difficulty discarding possessions, regardless of their actual value. This can lead to:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li><strong>Safety hazards:</strong> Blocked exits, fire risks, and structural damage</li>
            <li><strong>Health concerns:</strong> Poor air quality, pest infestations, and sanitation issues</li>
            <li><strong>Social isolation:</strong> Embarrassment preventing visitors or maintenance workers</li>
            <li><strong>Financial strain:</strong> Inability to use living spaces effectively</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional distress:</strong> Overwhelming feelings of shame and helplessness</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Our <strong>hoarding cleanup services in Oregon City and Portland</strong> address these challenges with sensitivity and professionalism, working alongside individuals and families to create safe, livable spaces once again.

            Our Compassionate Approach to Hoarding Cleanup
          </h2>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-600 mt-8 mb-4">
            1. Initial Consultation and Assessment
          </h3>
          <p>
            Every hoarding situation is unique. We begin with a confidential consultation to understand the specific challenges and goals. Our team assesses the property's condition, identifies safety concerns, and develops a customized cleanup plan that respects the individual's pace and comfort level.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-600 mt-8 mb-4">
            2. Collaborative Decision-Making
          </h3>
          <p>
            We never make decisions about possessions without the homeowner's input. Our <strong>Portland hoarding cleanup specialists</strong> work alongside clients, helping them sort through items and make informed decisions about what to keep, donate, or dispose of. This collaborative approach helps build confidence and reduces anxiety.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-600 mt-8 mb-4">
            3. Safe and Systematic Removal
          </h3>
          <p>
            Our trained professionals follow strict safety protocols during cleanup. We wear appropriate protective equipment, ensure proper ventilation, and carefully navigate cluttered spaces. Items are sorted into categories: keep, donate, recycle, and dispose, with everything handled according to local regulations.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-600 mt-8 mb-4">
            4. Deep Cleaning and Sanitization
          </h3>
          <p>
            Once items are removed, we provide thorough cleaning and sanitization services. This includes addressing any pest issues, cleaning surfaces, and ensuring the space is safe and healthy for habitation.
